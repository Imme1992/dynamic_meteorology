    "The weather is chaotic and perturbations of the fluid are happening in the atmosphere all the time. These perturbations can lead to instabilities. The most important instabilities in meteorology are related to wave propagation. An example of such a wave perturbation is shown with the Rossby adjustment problem in the shallow water practical.\n",
